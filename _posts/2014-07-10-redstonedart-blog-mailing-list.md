Hey everyone! Welcome to the new Redstone.dart blog :)

Recently, I've received a lot of feedback and questions about Redstone through many different channels, such as github, google plus, hangouts, e-mail and so on. 
It's really cool to see other developers excited about this project, but I've just realized that we need a proper place to discuss about it.

So, to fix this issue, I've created a mailing list for us:

[http://groups.google.com/d/forum/redstonedart](http://groups.google.com/d/forum/redstonedart)

If you have questions, or want to give some feedback about the project, don't hesitate to join the group and send us a message. Although, if you find a bug, or want to contribute some code, please file an issue at our [GitHub](https://github.com/luizmineo/redstone.dart) page.
